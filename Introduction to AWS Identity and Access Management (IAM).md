In modern business environments, secure access to systems and resources is critical. Organizations rely on authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only approved users can access sensitive information and services. Without proper access control, unauthorized users can exploit company resources such as shared folders, intranets, printers, and internal systems.

This project explores **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, a core AWS service that enables secure control of access to AWS resources. Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience in managing users, groups, and policies while understanding how access permissions are enforced within the AWS environment.

## Understanding AWS IAM

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a global AWS service that allows administrators to securely manage access to AWS resources. IAM enables the creation of users, assignment of permissions, and enforcement of security policies without sharing root account credentials.

IAM operates based on the principle of least privilege, meaning users are granted only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This minimizes security risks and ensures tighter control over cloud resources.
